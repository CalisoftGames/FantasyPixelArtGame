Main Character:

    From another realm, the halloween realm (working title)
    She is a witch with magic powers
    Also she is a strange blob-like creature
    Thats just how her people are, idk


Main Realm:

    This realm is heavily fantasy, but all the people are animals.
    There's ghosts and goblins and other things. Maybe they spilled in from another dimension,
    like the main character.


Town One NPCs:

    They are turtles! The warriors have coat-of-arms painted on their shells, while the nobles
    wear drapey cape thingies and greek-ish robes, maybe. The turtles are isolationists and purely
    fight to defend their village. They don't bother any other races, and the other races don't
    bother them. They are a lot like hobbits and a mix of japan and rome cultures, visually (maybe).
    they just want to chill in their cool turtle village, and don't want to take over the world or
    anything crazy like that. They just want to live a peaceful life in their village.
