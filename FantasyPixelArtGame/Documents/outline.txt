This is an outline for the game plan (lol)
This is a place for us to keep useful info to help guide us along the process

====================================================
Phase Zero:
    Dummy Sprites DONE!
    Software Architecture
    Combat Design Concept

Phase One:
    Create Sprite Assets
    Create Code
    Create Scripts
    Get movement working DONE!

Phase Two:
    Create environment
    Get Combat working
    Start quest script functions
    Start User Interface design

Phase Three:
    Complete combat balancing
    Create 3 scenes, Town, Road, and Dungeon
    Create quests and quest log


=================================================


First goal of the game is to create a single Town, Road, and Dungeon. This way we have a self contained, 
if small, playable game. If we get all three of these mechanic systems working, adding more content will
be (relatively) easy. 


Town:
    Purpose: Quests and Upgrades

    Talk to NPCs
    Form relationships with NPCs, like Stardew and Animal Crossing
    Enjoy beautiful scenery
    Shop
    Upgrade your character


Road:
    Purpose: Collecting Materials and Exploration

    Explore!
    Gather Materials!
    Find Quests and easter eggs
    Some Combat, but NOT LIKE POKEMON TALL GRASS


Dungeon:
    Purpose: Combat, Quests, and Material Collection

    FIGHT!
    Gather rare materials only found in the dungeons
    Complete quest objectives
    Fight Boss
